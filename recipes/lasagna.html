    <p>
        <strong>STEP 1:</strong><br><br>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat;<br>
        cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until trasnlucent, about 5 minutes. <br><br>
        <strong>STEP 2:</strong> <br> <br>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes,tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. <br> Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer,stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. <br> <br>
        <strong>STEP 3:</strong> <br> <br>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling <br> water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. <br> <br>
        <strong>STEP 4:</strong> <br> <br>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). <br> <br>
        <strong>STEP 5:</strong> <br> <br>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. <br> <br>
        <strong>STEP 6:</strong> <br> <br>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of <br> noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. <br> Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. <br> <br>
        <strong>STEP 7:</strong> <br> <br>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. <br> <br>
